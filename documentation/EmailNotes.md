Lilly: I was also thinking about how to talk about or summarize this project and this is my current understanding
(pls correct if I'm misunderstanding!)

This is a comparative study of the Snake, Green, and Wind River Basins in the western U.S.
Our goal is to examine how hydrology, governance, and management interact within and across these basins.
We are focusing on three main aspects: hydrology; water management, and socioeconomic/legal frameworks.
We are intersted in how these aspects interact to influence snowpack, climate dynamics, and streamflow.
Data sources include but are not limited to: USGS streamflow and groundwater records, NOAA/NCEI climate data,
PRISM and/or Daymet for weather, calculated indices like NDWI, soils and soil moisture, and ESA WorldCover, amongst others.

We invision our datasets aligning with earth, air, fire, and water, and, considering the RAD model,
have simplified management strategies in our study area to align these three basins as follows:
Snake River management priority (resist); Green River basin (direct); and Wind River (accept).
We plan to further develop our conceptual and hydrologic frameworks for these basins to assess hydrologic parameters,
management strategies, and other factors both within and across these basins.
This is a unique study area. The Snake River is a major interstate river with heavy agriculture and large dams, in Idaho, Wyoming, and Washington. A standout feature is the Snake River Plain Aquifer, a highly productive yet fragile groundwater system flowing through fractured basalt. Water moves quickly through this aquifer and discharges into the Snake River, supporting irrigation, hydropower, and ecosystems. Intensive pumping in the eastern plain has lowered water tables though.
The Green River, originating in Wyoming, is a major tributary of the Colorado River and goverened by Colorado River Compact allocations. The Wind River is smaller but hydrologically important, with local agriculture and tribal water rights shaping governance. These differences make a comparative study especially interesting, as each basin has distinct management approaches, power structures, and constraints.
The Snake River Basin is managed by federal agencies (Bureau of Rec and Army Corps), and Idaho state law. Water use is dominated by irrigation, hydropower, and aquaculture, with large, wealthy landowners and irrigation districts holding significant influence. Issues include balancing hydropower and irrigation, salmon restoration, and groundwater depletion in the aquifer. In this basin, economic interests and infrastructure drive management decisions to resist changes.
The Green River Basin is governed by the Colorado River Compact. Agriculture is the main water use (alfalfa and cattle), and dominates water demand, but municipal and energy needs are growing. Declining snowpack and drought pressures challenge fair water allocation. Compact obligations limit flexibility, creating a management narrative dominated by the desire to direct water in ways that might not be supportive of the natural hydrologic regime.
The Wind River Basin is unique because tribal sovereignty is central. The Shoshone and Arapahoe Tribes hold water rights confirmed through the Big Horn adjudication. Governance involves tribal, state, and federal agencies, supporting tribal agriculture, ranching, and cultural uses. Challenges include enforcing water rights against state pushback from Wyoming, funding infrastructure, and cultural values.
Across the basins, there are several comparative angles for us to assess: governance differences (economic power in Snake, legal compacts in Green, tribal sovereignty in Wind); equity (who benefits and who bears scarcity; and climate adaptation (flexibility versus lock-in; and narratives of power, economic influence, legal obligations, and cultural authority).
Our current working framework highlights how physical systems and governance interact, showing how hydrogeology, law, and social priorities shape water management. These systems provide us with an opportunity to assess how physical systems and different management strategies interact. As we continue, we will explore more datasets, partner dynamics, and strategies to further assess contrasts and their effectiveness between the basins.

Reflecting:
I heard a lot of nice ideas about teams today...
And, adding something to the wisdom with something that you can choose to hold onto or put down -- for I believe that it's often the songs/stories/ideas we agree to share that bring and keep us close. And so I share a story that came to mind while reflecting on the day.

Eháŋni, I worked in the Sonoran and Mojave deserts -- looking about for rare plants and critters -- so we might protect them. Long hours alone with nothing to listen to but Christian radio on the AM dial, or a CD I brought along.
And somehow I sent the price of postage to some rando who sent me like 50 cds of Michael Parenti, Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky, and Utah Phillips... And listening to Utah Phillips I learned a little about the Wobblies, and fundamentalist anarchism, and the idea of making voluntary combinations... 

The idea of voluntary combinations has stuck with me thru the years. And, maybe it makes sense to you in the context of working as a team; and maybe it doesn't -- no judgement...

Just sharing a past memory of somebody I never met.
Who treated me in a kind way.
Without obligation or acknowledgement.
And passing along a tiny bit of what they shared...

Mitakuye,

I shared some EDA-related ideas in the running notes that might be helpful in generating a refined set of hypotheses that might help in better defining a set of questions relating back to (smile, perhaps) effects of water management /water rights / water use on the discussion of resilience, response, community healing/empowerment.

Still, lotta paths to the top of the mountain...

Toksa,

These reading (listenings) sound great to me! 

Looking forward to working with everyone and continuing our discussions tomorrow.

Have a restful evening!

Hi Team,

Thanks for the great conversation today, and sorry I jetted so fast after food. Homework (lots of water law readings!). 

Just to get the "book club" started early, wanted to share a couple podcasts I love (neither have episodes directly related to water, but tons of other good content):

Nihizi: Indigenous Solutions: https://nihizhi.com/
All My Relations: https://www.allmyrelationspodcast.com/podcast

Also just finished Wynona LaDuke's "To Be a Water Protector" book: https://www.winonaladuke.com/books/p/wiindigoo-slayers

Happy to talk about any of these or share other great work. 
Have a great evening,
Ashley
