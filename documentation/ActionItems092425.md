Hi Everyone, 

Let's use this space to list our proposed individual action items moving forward from today (Sep. 24, 2025):

### Shared decision-making
- Vote on a team slogan.
  - I suggest: "Be Kind and respect others boundaries, capacity, and fallibility; otherwise, do as thou wilt shall be the whole of the law."
    - lol: *Think Indian and don't let nobody boss you around.*
  - Are there other slogans?

### Individual Action Items

- Darryl: try to get EMIT data downloaded

- Bob: Palmer Drought Index time series example for Wyoming Clime Division 2:

- cjt: Put together some semi-transferable scripts to choose gages, dl streamflow data, chunk it out into monthly descriptive stats -- then make some graphs or something.
