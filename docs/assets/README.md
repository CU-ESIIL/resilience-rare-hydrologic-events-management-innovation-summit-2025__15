# Adding Assets

1. Convert image to PNG. If originally HEIC or PDF:
    - Save as PDF (probably a huge file now).
    - Compress PDF (save space; overwrite your PDF).
    - Save as PNG.
3. Upload PNG to this folder using `Add file -> Upload Files`.
4. Find files on your machine and type a commit message, then commit.
5. Edit `index.md` in parent folder (`docs`).
6. Insert line with `![](assets/xxx.png)` where needed; look for examples there.
7. Use `Preview` (top left of page) to preview; toggle `Edit/Preview` until satisfied.
8. Click `Commit changes...`
