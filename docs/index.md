**One sentence on impact:** In three days, Group 15 is prototyping data stories and decision aids that help water managers anticipate rare hydrologic extremes and plan resilient responses.

## Day 1 ‚Äî Define & Explore
*Focus: questions, hypotheses, context; add at least one visual (photo of whiteboard/notes).*

### Our product üì£
- Rapid brief highlighting flood preparedness scenarios for Colorado River Basin communities.
- Map-based story showing infrastructure hotspots sensitive to extreme rainfall.

### Our question(s) üì£
- Which basins and communities are most exposed to rare, high-intensity precipitation events?
- How can we blend precipitation frequency analyses with social vulnerability indicators to prioritize mitigation investments?
- What data storytelling formats communicate risk and resilience actions clearly to decision makers?

### Hypotheses / intentions [Optional: probably not relevant if you are creating an educational tool]
- We think that combining NOAA Atlas 14 design storms with updated climate projections will reveal emerging risk hotspots.
- We intend to test whether infrastructure-critical assets align with high social vulnerability scores.
- We will know we‚Äôre onto something if partners can quickly point to actionable ‚Äúnext step‚Äù mitigation actions from our visuals.

### Why this matters (the ‚Äúupshot‚Äù) üì£
Extreme hydrologic events are becoming less predictable, stressing emergency management capacity. Highlighting the intersection of exposure, vulnerability, and infrastructure sensitivity helps local leaders justify investments in resilient design and community preparedness.

### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)
- Publication: [NOAA Atlas 14 Guidance](https://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/)
- Dataset portal: [USGS StreamStats](https://streamstats.usgs.gov/)
- Tool/tech: [FEMA Hazus flood mitigation library](https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/tools-resources/hazus)

## Day 2 ‚Äî Data & Methods
*Focus: what we‚Äôre testing and building; show a first visual (plot/map/screenshot/GIF).*

### Data sources we‚Äôre exploring üì£
- **NOAA Atlas 14 extreme precipitation grids** ‚Äî baseline design storms to benchmark current planning thresholds.

  [Raw photo location: explore_data_plot.png](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/resilience-rare-hydrologic-events-management-innovation-summit-2025__15/blob/main/docs/assets/explore_data_plot.png)
  *Snapshot: 24-hour return-period rainfall values for pilot watersheds.*

- **NASA IMERG precipitation time series** ‚Äî near-real-time anomaly tracking for event attribution.
- **US Census SVI indicators** ‚Äî spatial context for vulnerable populations potentially affected by flash flooding.

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
- Rainfall frequency adjustment factors derived from downscaled climate projections.
- Rapid flood exposure mapping using Google Earth Engine and publicly available elevation models.
- Lightweight dashboards assembled with Plotly Express for communicating uncertainty.

### Challenges identified
- Reconciling spatial resolution differences between gridded precipitation and community-level indicators.
- Limited compute time for running high-resolution hydrologic models within the sprint window.
- Need for vetted narratives that balance urgency with uncertainty when briefing decision makers.

- Extreme 24-hour rainfall could exceed existing design thresholds by 15‚Äì25% in key headwater basins.
- Critical facilities such as wastewater plants and emergency shelters cluster inside high-risk catchments.
- Incorporating social vulnerability indicators shifts priority outreach zones toward downstream communities.
