## Day 1 ‚Äî Define & Explore
*Focus: questions, hypotheses, context; add at least one visual (photo of whiteboard/notes).*

### Our product üì£
This is a comparative study of the Snake, Green, and Wind River Basins in the western U.S. Our goal is to examine how hydrology, governance, and management interact within and across these basins. We are focusing on three main aspects: hydrology; water management, and socioeconomic/legal frameworks. We are intersted in how these aspects interact to influence snowpack, climate dynamics, and streamflow. Data sources include but are not limited to: USGS streamflow and groundwater records, NOAA/NCEI climate data, PRISM and/or Daymet for weather, calculated indices like NDWI, soils and soil moisture, and ESA WorldCover, amongst others.

### Our question(s) üì£
- How are current river management practices affecting communities and ecosystems?
- What is the response of river communities and ecosystems to hydrologic and meteorologic events?
- How do we measure response and resilience?

### Hypotheses / intentions [Optional: probably not relevant if you are creating an educational tool]
- We think that combining NOAA Atlas 14 design storms with updated climate projections will reveal emerging risk hotspots.
- We intend to test whether infrastructure-critical assets align with high social vulnerability scores.
- We will know we‚Äôre onto something if partners can quickly point to actionable ‚Äúnext step‚Äù mitigation actions from our visuals.

### Why this matters (the ‚Äúupshot‚Äù) üì£
Extreme hydrologic events are becoming less predictable, stressing emergency management capacity. Highlighting the intersection of exposure, vulnerability, and infrastructure sensitivity helps local leaders justify investments in resilient design and community preparedness.

### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)
- Publication: [NOAA Atlas 14 Guidance](https://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/)
- Dataset portal: [USGS StreamStats](https://streamstats.usgs.gov/)
- Tool/tech: [FEMA Hazus flood mitigation library](https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/tools-resources/hazus)

## Day 2 ‚Äî Data & Methods
*Focus: what we‚Äôre testing and building; show a first visual (plot/map/screenshot/GIF).*

### Data sources we‚Äôre exploring üì£
<!-- EDIT: Link each source; add size/notes if relevant. -->
- **Source A**
- Source B ‚Äî link and 1-line description

- **NOAA Atlas 14 extreme precipitation grids** ‚Äî baseline design storms to benchmark current planning thresholds.

  ![Pattern revealed during exploration](assets/explore_data_plot.png)

  *Snapshot: 24-hour return-period rainfall values for pilot watersheds.*

- **NASA IMERG precipitation time series** ‚Äî near-real-time anomaly tracking for event attribution.
- **US Census SVI indicators** ‚Äî spatial context for vulnerable populations potentially affected by flash flooding.

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
- Approach 1 (e.g., time-series break detection)
- Approach 2 (e.g., random forest on features)
- Visualization (e.g., map tiles, small multiples)

### Challenges identified
- Data gaps / quality issues
- Method limitations / compute constraints
- Open questions we need to decide on

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
- Rainfall frequency adjustment factors derived from downscaled climate projections.
- Rapid flood exposure mapping using Google Earth Engine and publicly available elevation models.
- Lightweight dashboards assembled with Plotly Express for communicating uncertainty.

### Challenges identified
- Reconciling spatial resolution differences between gridded precipitation and community-level indicators.
- Limited compute time for running high-resolution hydrologic models within the sprint window.
- Need for vetted narratives that balance urgency with uncertainty when briefing decision makers.

### Visuals
<!-- EDIT: Swap examples; keep file sizes modest. -->
